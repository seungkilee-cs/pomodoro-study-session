    "Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:\n",
    "\n",
    "The power function calculates x raised to the nth power. If implemented in O(n) it would simply be a for loop over n and multiply x n times. Instead implement this power function in O(log n) time. You can assume that n will be a non-negative integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some starting code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pow(x:int, n:int) -> int:\n",
    "  # Fill this in.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pow(5, 3))\n",

    "# Observation\n",
    "- Definition of power suggests that brute force solution to this problem will yield `O(n)` time complexity\n",
    "- looking for `O(log n)` time complexity\n",
    "- Assume n is geq 0\n",
    "- There's no constraint on the space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things catch my eyes. \n",
    "1. Why give non negative n? This must mean negative power cannot be processed using the solution they want.\n",
    "2. Why not mention the space complexity? I understand we care less about space in general, but this specifies logarithmic time complexity. This alludes to trading off space complexity for time complexity.\n",
    "3. Specifically looking for log(n) time. Remember that log(n) time complexity requires the size of processed input to be halved for each iteration."
