    "\n",
    "With no contraints, I would do the following.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def reverseWord(word: [str]) -> str:\n",
    "    return ''.join(word).split()[::-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "lovely python magic that turns `[str]` to `str` then split it on white space char, then slice it backwards. Take O(N) Time O(N) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part about this is doing it `in-place` which means no additional memory that grows with size of the input - not necessarily no auxiliary variable. We've observed that storing an entire word to place in the right part of the sentence does not work. To avoid storing a whole word, we need a way to keep the word data without actually holding the word. This can be done by holding on to the start and end indices of a word. later we can access the word by giving it `message[word_start:word_end]` \n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes swapping the word into the right place. Best way to swap the location of structured date in-place is by buffer and replace three way swap that follows:\n",
    "1. place elemA in the buffer\n",
    "2. place elemB in position of elemA\n",
    "3. place the buffer into elemB?\n",
    "4. do this until the swap termination condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this and the no constraint approach, my intuition is to:\n",
    "1. reverse the entire array\n",
    "2. have two ptrs, start/end of a word\n",
    "3. move end until end hits an whitespace character\n",
    "4. once it encounters a whitespace character, reverse the subarray that contains the word\n",
    "5. move start to the start of a new word\n",

    "I can reduce the memory usage to `O(m)` of the smaller array. As `len(arr)` has time complexity of `O(1)` I can take the length of two arrays to get the size of the smaller of the two array. Then, append an empty array of size m to the end of larger array. To avoid overwriting the data, I can have three ptrs, one at the last value of larger array `ptr1` and one at the end of the smaller array `ptr2`. Lastly, have a pointer to the end of the large, concatted array `ptrWrite`. Then, make the comparison from the two pointers pointing at actual values and place the larger element at the location of `ptrWrite`. This is essentially sorting in a decending order, while traversing backwards. This is to avoid holding values of both arrays separately. If we sort from the start, then we are comparing the values that CANNOT yet be overwritten. By writing from the back of an empty list, we have the buffer to be sure that if any values are overwritten we know those values are already tracked at the later half of the appended list."
