    "## Observation\n",
    "1. If I do this brute force, I will have to compare every single contiguous sum. This would be $O(n^2)$ time\n",
    "2. The bottleneck here comes from the algorithm to get the maximum contiguous sum at each point. How can I reduce this?\n",
    "3. Note that I am checking for the largest sum, which is a computed value that can be encoded to one integer.\n",
    "4. If the next number is negative, then I know I can stop at current index to add to the contiguous sum. This \"Window\" has reached its local maximum. Even if the next.next number is massive, it would yield me better sum if I start from next.next rather than continue the sum.\n",
    "5. When I stop at this current index, I know mathematically I can disregard everything up to that point by the loosely defined proof below.\n",
    "6. With observation 5 I can always know the maximum contiguous array that contains current index value.\n",
    "7. However I cannot always guarantee that I know the global maximum value even if I have the local maximum.\n",

    "### Proof of Lcal Maximum  \n",
    "\n",
    "let n be size of the array  \n",
    "let m be arbitrary midway point such that $0 < m < n$  \n",
    "If so, the below must hold  \n",

    "$\\Sigma_{i=0}^{m} f(i) + f({m+1}) < \\Sigma_{i=0}^{n} f(i)$  \n",
    "$\\rightarrow f({m+1}) > 0$  \n",
    "$\\rightarrow \\Sigma_{i=0}^{n} < \\Sigma_{i=m+1}^{n}$  \n",
    "$\\therefore$ , we know that we can discard everything to the left of current index if `sum(arr[0:m]) + arr[m+1]` < `arr[m+1]`"

    "## Approach\n",
    "1. set the first element of the array as our local/global maximum\n",
    "2. as I traverse the array, check if sum of current local maximum and current value is greater than the current value and place the larger value in local maximum. If n is larger than the sum, it would mean we need to restart the window because previous localMax must've contained negative number and we benefit from a brand new window starting from n.\n",
